2025-08	Conveying gender through speech: insights from trans men.	Interspeech	"Focusing on the understudied population of trans men, we present one of the first studies on style shift in trans speakers, considering the phonetic features of trans men's speech in different contexts, and their own beliefs about vocal cues to gender perception."

2024-12	Beyond the binary: Limitations and possibilities of gender-related speech technology research.	IEEE SLT	"This paper presents a review of 107 research papers relating to speech and sex or gender in ISCA Interspeech publications between 2013 and 2023. We note the scarcity of work on this topic and find that terminology, particularly the word gender, is used in ways that are underspecified and often out of step with the prevailing view in social sciences that gender is socially constructed and is a spectrum as opposed to a binary category."

2024-06	Is there an uncanny valley for speech? Investigating listeners' evaluations of realistic TTS voices.	Speech Prosody	"In this paper, we aim to describe the relationship between synthesised voices' perceived human-likeness and pleasantness and seek evidence of auditory uncanny valley effects (UVE) in listeners' evaluations."
