- [CDT in Natural Language Processing](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/ukri-cdt-in-natural-language-processing), Cohort 2023
- PhD Fellow, [Centre for Technomoral Futures](https://www.technomoralfutures.uk/)
- Member, [Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/)

I am working towards a PhD, supervised by [Dr. Catherine Lai](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/) and [Prof. Lauren Hall-Lew](https://laurenhall-lew.weebly.com/), at the University of Edinburgh. I approach speech technology and its applications from a feminist/anarchist angle. Autonomy, accessibility and sustainability are key values, and I'm interested in what we stand to gain and lose in adopting new technologies: Who is empowered? Who is disenfranchised?
